# Hilo 
A game of chance. How far are you willing to push it? A game where you push the limits of fate. 
You start with 300 points and a card with a number is presented. Do you bet on the next card being higher or lower? Guess it right, you gain 100 points, guess it wrong, you lose 75 points.
If you reach zero points the game is over.

## Getting Started

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
