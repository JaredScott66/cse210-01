You rush to the cabinet and close the door. Through the slit in the door, you see what seems to be a man in a space suit slowly walk in. But something about him unnerves you. He walks unnaturally, and makes no sound other than his foots steps.
He walks in, grasping the air as if he is trying to grap hold of someone. You remain silent as he walks silently around the room and walks back the way he came in.
After the figure leaves, you step out of the cabinet. There is the door which the figure just left through. Or there is the door up the stairs
What do you do?
